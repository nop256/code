'''Exercise: Color Constructor

-------------------------

### Description

In this series of exercises, you will create a class to represent
a `Color`.  For our purposes, a color is comprised 
of 3 integer values.  They represent how much red,
green and blue are used in making the color.
The minimum amount for each value is 0, and the
maximum amount is 255.

For this exercise, you are only responsible for
creating the constructor, and making sure the
amounts of red, green and blue are stored
in the object.
