Create a Graphing calculator.
As part of the assignment, you must implement your own Stack class.
Your program should let the user enter an expression of their choice.
Convert their expression with a function InfixToPostfix
Plot their expression with a function EvaluatePostfix
Use graphics.py or pygame.py.
You may need to do coordinate transformations from world to pixel coordinates.

Assume the user enters valid expressions, so you do not need error checking.
Valid expressions consists of single digit integers, the variable x, the operators +, -, /, and *, and parenthesis.
You can choose to not allow any spaces, though it's not hard to allow them.
(Be sure to make your limitations clear when you prompt the user to enter an expression.)
Test your program on several expressions, such as "x*x*x/(2*5)".
