Enhance 'insert' project by having your container class support the __iter__, Delete, and Retrieve methods.
After your main function Inserts students into your container class, add the following:
Iterate through all students in your container class, and print their average age with at least 4 digits of accuracy.
Print how many seconds that took.
Delete all students in DeleteNames.txt, and print how long that took.
Retrieve all students in RetrieveNames.txt, print their average age (again, with 4+ decimal accuracy), and print how long that took.
Also, be sure to print any SSN numbers from the Retrieve and Delete lists that were not there.

NOTE 1: Don't try to do any optimizing at this point.
NOTE 2: You may want to create smaller versions of the Insert, Delete, and Retrieve lists that have, say, only 10 or 20 items.
Then you won't have to wait so long while developing and debugging your code.
