BST
Create another container class for storing unordered unique Students.
It should support the methods: Exists, Insert, Traverse, Delete, Retrieve, and Size.
Implement the methods using a Binary Search Tree (BST).
Repeat the previous assignment using your new BST container class.
Compare the Insert, Traverse, Delete, and Retrieve times to the previous containers.
Verify that the average ages and the error messages are the same.
After you get it working with the regular lists, try it on the Medium sized lists: FakeNamesMedium.txt, DeleteNamesMedium.txt, and RetrieveNamesMedium.txt.
In this case, do not print every student that failed to insert, delete, or retrieve. Just print the total fails in each category.
