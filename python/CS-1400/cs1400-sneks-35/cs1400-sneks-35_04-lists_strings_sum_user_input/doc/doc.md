# 35.4) Sum User Input

Recall the Input/Split/Loop pattern and the Sum pattern. For this problem, you
should combine these two patterns to read in a comma-separated string of numbers
from the user, separate each number, and then print the sum of these numbers.
For example, if the user typed in the string "10,20,30", your code should print
60. You do not need to write a function.
