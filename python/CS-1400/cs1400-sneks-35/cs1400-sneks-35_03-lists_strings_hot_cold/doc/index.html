<p>A scientist has been recording observations of the temperature for the past
while. On hot days, they write &#34;H&#34;, and for cold days, they write &#34;C&#34;. Instead
of using a list, they kept all of these observations in a single long string
(e.g., &#34;HCH&#34; would be a hot day, followed by a cold day, and then another hot
day).</p>

<p>Write a function <code>add_hot_cold</code> that consumes a string of observations and
returns the number of hot days minus the number of cold days. To accomplish
this, you should process each letter in turn and add 1 if it is hot, and -1 if
it is cold. For example, the string &#34;HCH&#34; would result in 1, while the string
&#34;CHCC&#34; would result in -2.</p>

<p>You cannot use the built-in <code>.count()</code> method or the <code>len()</code> function for this
problem.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget to unit test your function.</p>
