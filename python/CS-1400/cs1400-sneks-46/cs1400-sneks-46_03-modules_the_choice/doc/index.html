<p>The <code>random</code> module has a function named <code>choice</code> that consumes a sequence (list
or string) and returns a single element from that sequence, chosen at random.
Create a list literal of your four favorite dinner spots in the area, store it
in a variable, and then use this function to print one of them randomly (you are
recommended, but not required, to go there for dinner tonight).</p>
