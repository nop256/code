<p>The <code>string</code> module has a variable named <code>ascii_letters</code>. Import this variable,
and use it to write the function <code>starts_with_letter</code> that consumes a word (as a
non-empty string) and returns whether the first character of that word is a
letter (as opposed to a number or symbol). Remember to unit test your function.</p>

<p>Technically, this function violates our scope rules - however, it is okay
because we are not changing the value inside letters (it&#39;s a global constant).</p>
