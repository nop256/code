# 32.4) Function with For

Define a function `print_fahrenheit` that consumes a single list of temperatures
in Celsius. It should use a `for` loop to print the result of converting each
element of the list to Fahrenheit. Use the code in the given program to call
this function; you do not have to write any unit tests.

Notice that this function *prints* out the results instead of returning them.
You should always read the description of the function carefully.

Here is the formula again:

    Fahrenheit = Celsius * 9 / 5 + 32
