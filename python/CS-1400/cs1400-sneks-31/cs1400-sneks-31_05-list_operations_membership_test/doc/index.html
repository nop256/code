<p>Assume that you are developing a system to process lists containing days of the
week, represented as strings. Create a function <code>is_weekend</code> that consumes such
a list and returns whether it has the string <code>&#34;Saturday&#34;</code> or the string
<code>&#34;Sunday&#34;</code> in it. Unit test this function with a list of days of the week.</p>
