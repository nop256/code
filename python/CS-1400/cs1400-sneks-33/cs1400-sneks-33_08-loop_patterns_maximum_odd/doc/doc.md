# 33.8) Maximum Odd

Use the Min/Max pattern to write a function called `maximum_odd` that finds the
highest odd value in the list (consumes a non-empty list of numbers and returns
a number). To determine if a number is odd, use the provided helper function
`is_odd` that consumes a single number and returns a Boolean indicating whether
it is odd (True) or even (False). Do not change the helper function `is_odd` but
you should unit test both functions.

Note: You can assume there will always be at least one odd number in the list.
