# 45.4) Plus or Minus

Create a function named `convert_operator`, which consumes a string (a single
character, either a "+" or a "-") and returns either 1 or -1, respectively.
Return 0 for any other character.

Then apply this function to the contents of the given file
(`plus_and_minus.txt`) to calculate and then print the sum of all these pluses
and minuses (so, an integer number). Notice that the file is entirely on one
line. Therefore, you should use the `read` method to access its contents. But
you should only pass one character at a time to the function you write!

Don't forget to unit test your function.
