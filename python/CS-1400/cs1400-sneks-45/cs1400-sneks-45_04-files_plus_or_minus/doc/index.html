<p>Create a function named <code>convert_operator</code>, which consumes a string (a single
character, either a &#34;+&#34; or a &#34;-&#34;) and returns either 1 or -1, respectively.
Return 0 for any other character.</p>

<p>Then apply this function to the contents of the given file
(<code>plus_and_minus.txt</code>) to calculate and then print the sum of all these pluses
and minuses (so, an integer number). Notice that the file is entirely on one
line. Therefore, you should use the <code>read</code> method to access its contents. But
you should only pass one character at a time to the function you write!</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget to unit test your function.</p>
