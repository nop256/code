# 45.6) File Size

Write a function called `calculate_file_size` that consumes the name of a file
as a string and returns an integer representing the number of characters that
are in the file (including whitespace). Use the Count pattern. You may not use
the built-in `len` function nor the `.read()` method. How can you count each
character in the file when the basic `for` loop for files only gives you each
line in the file?

Call your function on the files `rainfall.txt`, `names.txt`, and then
`empty.txt` to unit test your function three times. The rainfall file has 28830
characters, the names file has 119 characters, and the empty file has 0
characters.

WARNING: It may take about a minute to finish running all of the tests.
