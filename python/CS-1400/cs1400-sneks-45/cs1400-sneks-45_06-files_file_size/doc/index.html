<p>Write a function called <code>calculate_file_size</code> that consumes the name of a file
as a string and returns an integer representing the number of characters that
are in the file (including whitespace). Use the Count pattern. You may not use
the built-in <code>len</code> function nor the <code>.read()</code> method. How can you count each
character in the file when the basic <code>for</code> loop for files only gives you each
line in the file?</p>

<p>Call your function on the files <code>rainfall.txt</code>, <code>names.txt</code>, and then
<code>empty.txt</code> to unit test your function three times. The rainfall file has 28830
characters, the names file has 119 characters, and the empty file has 0
characters.</p>

<p>WARNING: It may take about a minute to finish running all of the tests.</p>
