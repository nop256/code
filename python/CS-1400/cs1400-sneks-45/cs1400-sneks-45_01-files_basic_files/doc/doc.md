# 45.1) Basic Files

Assume there is a file named "grocery_list.txt" in the same directory as your
python program. Use the built-in `open` function on this file, print each line
using a `for` loop, and then `close` the file. Remember to remove the extra
newline character from the end of each line using the `strip` method.

You do not need to create the grocery list file, the Code Grinder tests will
automatically create it for you.
