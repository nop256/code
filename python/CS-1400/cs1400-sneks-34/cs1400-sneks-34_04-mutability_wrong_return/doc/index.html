<html><head></head><body><h1>34.4) Wrong Return</h1>

<p>The function <code>get_front_of_weekdays</code> consumes a string representing a day of the
week, and returns &#34;weekend&#34; if it is a Sunday or Saturday, or returns the day
without the &#34;day&#34; part at the end. However, it does not seem to be returning the
right values. Diagnose the issue and fix the function.</p>
