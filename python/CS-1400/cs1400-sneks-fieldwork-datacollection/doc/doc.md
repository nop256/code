# Fieldwork: Data Collection

You need to create a survey question. You have great freedom to think of a
question, but it should be creative and unique.

The only technical requirement is that the answer to the question should be a
[non-nominal number](https://www.mymarketresearchmethods.com/types-of-data-nominal-ordinal-interval-ratio/). The term non-nominal is used to avoid questions where the
numbers are being used as labels, and they have no order or numerical significance.

For example, here are some GOOD questions (but you can't use them):

- How many corgis do you wish you owned?
- How many pages are in your favorite book?
- What is the ideal number of people to have at a party?
- How many colors do you hate?
- How wide is your favorite blanket?

Here are some BAD questions, because they are nominal:

- What is your gender? 0 is male, 1 is female, 2 is other.
- What is your hair color? 0 is blonde, 1 is black, 2 is brown, 3 is other.
- Where are you from? 0 is Delaware, 1 is not Delaware.
- What is your favorite number?

When you have formulated your survey question, you will need to ask at least 16
people your question. Obviously, there is no strict way to enforce this process,
but know you that you are signing an honor pledge to actually complete this
assignment (and falsifying data constitutes an academic honor violation). You
are free to ask whoever you want - it might be 16 classmates, it might be some
of your dorm mates, it could be strangers off the street. You do not have to
track names, just their answers. You are free to ask more than 16 people, but
you must ask at least 16 people.

To pass the tests, you will need to submit a Python file with four
variables/values:

- Your survey question, stored as a string literal in a variable named QUESTION.
- Your survey results, stored as a list literal in a variable named ANSWERS.
- Your name, stored as a string literal in a variable named NAME.
- The following text, stored as a string literal in a variable named PLEDGE.

Here is the text for the pledge:

> "I swear that I actually asked this question of at least 16 people and
> recorded their data without modifying the results. I understand that
> falsifying data in this course is an academic honor code violation."
