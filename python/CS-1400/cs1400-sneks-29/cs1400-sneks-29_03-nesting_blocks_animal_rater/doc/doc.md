# 29.3) Animal Rater

Create a function named `rate_animal` that will rate the value of different
animals on a numeric scale (1-4, where 1 is best and 4 is worst). Your function
should consume a variable named `animal` that represents the type of animal as a
string, and return an integer from 1-4 for each of four respective inputs:
`"dog"`, `"cat"`, `"capybara"`, and `"danger noodle"`. Each animal should have
its own value. If the string given is not one of these animals, return `-1`.

Use your function to print out the rating for your favorite animal. You should
consider writing unit tests, but you are not required to do so.
