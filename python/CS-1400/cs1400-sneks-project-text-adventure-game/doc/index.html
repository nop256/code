<p>You may pass this off with your instructor if the Code Grinder tests do not
align with your game design. For this to happen the following must be met:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each location dictionary in the world map must include only the keys
&#34;neighbors&#34; and &#34;stuff&#34;.</li>
<li>The player must include only the keys &#34;location&#34; and &#34;inventory&#34;.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other functionality than what is mentioned above is ok, you will just need to
get your project passed off manually by your instructor.</p>

<p>You will find the complete instructions in Canvas.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Your game should be original, to some degree. Do not reproduce an existing
game, although original perspectives or unique takes on existing games are ok.</li>
<li>You should include sample win and lose paths (one of each) in the <code>paths.py</code>
file. These paths are the commands a user might enter if they were going to
win or lose the game, respectively.</li>
<li>You must have a <code>get_options()</code> function that, when given a world dictionary,
determines the player&#39;s current status (e.g., location) and returns a list of
available commands for the user to select from.</li>
<li>You must have an <code>update()</code> function that, when given a world dictionary and a
command, updates the world based on the command and returns a string that
describes the results of executing the given command.</li>
<li>You must not call the <code>print()</code> or <code>input()</code> functions inside of any function
definition other than the <code>choose()</code> and <code>main()</code> functions.</li>
<li>The user should be able to move around the map.</li>
<li>The map should be large enough to make the game interesting.</li>
<li>The user should be able to quit the game from any location in the map (i.e.,
the &#34;quit&#34; command should always be available).</li>
<li>You should have extra logic other than moving around the map (e.g., picking up
and using items).</li>
<li>Do not use external libraries.</li>
</ul>
