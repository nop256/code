heater or air conditioner where the temperature is outside the
desired range.</p>

<p>Write a function that simulates a thermostat. It takes the current
temperature as its only argument and does the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the temperature is below 68, return 1 to start the heater</li>
<li>If the temperature is above 75, return -1 to start the AC</li>
<li>In every other case, return 0</li>
</ul>

<p>Write your function in <code>thermostat.s</code></p>
