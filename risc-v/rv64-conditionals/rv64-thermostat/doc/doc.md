A thermostat monitors the current temperature and turns on the
heater or air conditioner where the temperature is outside the
desired range.

Write a function that simulates a thermostat. It takes the current
temperature as its only argument and does the following:

*   If the temperature is below 68, return 1 to start the heater
*   If the temperature is above 75, return -1 to start the AC
*   In every other case, return 0

Write your function in `thermostat.s`
