# Code Practice: C, Python, and RISC-V

This repository contains my personal programming practice files in both C and Python.  
Each file represents a focused exercise, challenge, or concept I'm working through as I learn and improve.  
The goal is to demonstrate progress, develop strong fundamentals, and build a solid portfolio of code over time.

---

## üß† Purpose

- Develop fluency with core programming concepts
- Practice with low-level C and high-level Python in parallel
- Track my improvement over time through clean, well-commented code
- Build a base of code samples that I can share professionally

---

## üìÅ Folder Structure
/c # Practice exercises using
/c/pointers
/python # Practice exercises using Python

---

Each file is self-contained and may include:
- A short description or prompt
- One or more functions or mini-programs
- My own implementation and testing

---

## ‚úÖ What You'll Find

- Function-based problem solving
- Pointers, arrays, loops, and conditionals in C
- Data structures, algorithms, and Pythonic code
- Progressive code quality and readability over time

---

## üöß Still Improving

This repo is a work-in-progress. As I learn more, I will:
- Add comments and documentation to older files
- Refactor code for clarity or performance
- Include more advanced topics (e.g., structs, file I/O, memory management)

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me

I'm a student of Computer Science with a strong interest in systems-level programming, machine learning, and software engineering.
I created this repo to build discipline, track improvement, and hopefully help others along the way.
