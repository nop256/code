Print a diamond
---------------

Write a function in `diamond.c` to match the prototype in `main.c`.
This function should print a diamond to the screen of a certain
size. A diamond of size 2 looks like:

```
 *
***
 *
```

and a diamond of size 5 looks like:

```
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
 *******
  *****
   ***
    *
```

(the backticks are part of the markdown formatting, only consider
the lines with stars).

You may find it helpful to think of this as separate problems for
the top and bottom halves of the diamond, and you may split it into
helper functions if you like.
