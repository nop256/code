/*
 * Write 2 functions, one of which calls the other.
 *
 * The first function should check whether the number pointed to by 'elt' is zero.
 * If it is zero, replace it with -1 and return 1 to indicate it was modified.
 * If it is non-zero, do nothing and return 0.
 *
 * Prototype: int replace_zero_with_negative_one(int *elt);
 *
 * The second function should loop through the 'len' elements in lst,
 * call the helper function on each one, and return the number of modified elements.
 *
 * Prototype: int fix_zeros(int *lst, int len);
 *
 * In main, define an array with some zeros in it,
 * call fix_zeros on it, and print both the modified array and the number of changes.
