Completed: Python - Hash Tables: began writing hash table program logic

========================================
Date: 2025-04-08 18:27:43
Completed: Python - Hash Tables: wrote a working prime number generator for hash table size

========================================
Date: 2025-04-09 22:35:21
Completed: Python - Hash Tables: trying to understand how to implement resizeable logic for the hash table

========================================
Date: 2025-04-10 16:03:41
Completed: Python - Hash: refactored file-traversal container class to use a Hash Table

========================================
Date: 2025-04-11 19:48:27
Completed: C - Bit Manipulation: revisited bit manipulation functions 

========================================
Date: 2025-04-12 23:19:01
Completed: C - Pointers: revisited pointer functions to recommit understanding to memory 

========================================
Date: 2025-04-13 19:48:27
Completed: Python - Linked Lists: rewrote linked lists programs from memory to reinforce understanding of circular link list logic

========================================
Date: 2025-04-14 22:08:39
Completed: C - Structs: began writing wordle solver in C

========================================
Date: 2025-04-15 21:33:16
Completed: Python - Hash Tables: refactored the completed resizeable table to use a static size to test speeds with large data sets

========================================
Date: 2025-04-16 01:32:38
Completed: Python - Hash Tables: troubleshooting bugs with non-resizeable hash tables. Added circular probe exit check to break a possible infinite loop after a full probing cycle, fixed double increments of index in delete, and considering using a unique sentinel for deleted slots instead of False. Is using False as a deletion marker causing the probe to occasionally miss the correct spot?

========================================
Date: 2025-04-16 13:55:19
Completed: C - Structs: wrote various c programs to better understand nesting of structs and moving structs by value versus using pointers to them

========================================
Date: 2025-04-17 20:19:33
Completed: C - Structs: Practiced writing programs using nested structs and pointers

========================================
Date: 2025-04-17 20:20:02
Completed: Python - Powers: Ran a few practice runs for the powers quiz and big-o quiz

========================================
Date: 2025-04-17 20:27:42
Completed: Python - Hash Tables: trying to figure out an optimized prime number generator using primality caching for typical table sizes and investigating logic for a possible 6k Â± 1 implementation. Maybe combining them is slightly faster?
